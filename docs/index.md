# Bitwarden Provider

Use the Bitwarden provider to interact with Bitwarden logins, secure notes and folders.
You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it, and have the [Bitwarden CLI] installed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    bitwarden = {
      source  = "maxlaverse/bitwarden"
      version = ">= 0.6.2"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Bitwarden Provider
provider "bitwarden" {
  email           = "terraform@example.com"
}

# Create a Bitwarden Login Resource
resource "bitwarden_item_login" "example" {
  name            = "Example"
  username        = "service-account"
  password        = "<sensitive>"
}
```

## Authentication
The Bitwarden provider can use different combinations of credentials to authenticate:
* Email and Password (requires `email` and `master_password`)
* API key (requires `email`, `master_password`, `client_id` and `client_secret`)
* user-provided Session Key (requires `session_key`)

### Generating a Client ID and Secret
The recommended way to interact with your Vault using the Bitwarden Provider Terraform plugin is to generate an API key.
This allows you to easily revoke access to your Vault without having to change your master password.

In order to generate a pair of Client ID and Secret, you need to:
1. Connect to your Vault on https://vault.bitwarden.com, or your self-hosted instance
2. Click on _Settings_ and then _My Account_
3. Scroll down to the _API Key_ section
4. Click on _View API Key_ (or maybe another label if it's the first time)
5. Save the API credentials somewhere safe

### Generating a Session Key

If you don't want to use an API key, you can use a Session Key instead.
When doing so, it's your responsibility to:
* ensure the validity of the Session Key
* keep the Session Key safe
* revoke it when you don't need it anymore

You can generate a Session Key by running the following command in your Terraform Workspace:
```
BITWARDENCLI_APPDATA_DIR=.bitwarden bw login

# or if you use a custom vault path
BITWARDENCLI_APPDATA_DIR=<vault_path> bw login
```

## Configuration
Configuration for the Bitwarden Provider can be derived from two sources:
* Parameters in the provider configuration
* Environment variables

### Parameters
Credentials can be provided by adding a `master_password` and optionally `client_id` and `client_secret` to the bitwarden provider block.
```terraform
provider "bitwarden" {
  email           = "terraform@example.com"
  master_password = "my-master-password"
  client_id       = "my-client-id"
  client_secret   = "my-client-secret"
}
```

### Environment variables
Credentials can be provided by using the `BW_PASSWORD` and optionally `BW_CLIENTID` and `BW_CLIENTSECRET` environment variables. 

For example:
```bitwarden
provider "bitwarden" {}
```

```console
export BW_EMAIL="terraform@example.com"
export BW_PASSWORD="my-master-password"
export BW_CLIENTID="my-client-id"
export BW_CLIENTSECRET="my-client-secret"
```
